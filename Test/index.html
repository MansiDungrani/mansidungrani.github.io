                        <p>As an ITM student at IIT Chicago, I am passionate about web development, a subject I chose for my first semester. I've been immersed in learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other relevant technologies, both in the classroom and through hands-on experience. I've already begun applying my skills to personal projects and contributing to open-source initiatives, eager to make an impact in the field.</p>
